# Assignment 10: Image Search
--------------------

**Goal:** Implement a simplified version of Google Image Search.

This is a GUI assignment. Please setup a Github repo like previous assignments. There is no GUI template, but we encourage you to reuse code from earlier homeworks.

**Deliverables:**
 - A github repo containing all the code necessary to reproduce your results, including a `Makefile`.
 - A 1-2 minute video demonstrating the requirements.

**Requirements:**
 - The user can input a text query. After hitting the search button, the user should see the top 5 most relevant images from the database along with their similarity scores.
 - The user can upload an image query. Again, return the top-5 relevant images along with similarity scores.
 - The user can upload both an image and text query. In this case, the user can enter a value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating how much to weigh the text query relative to the image query. Again, return the top-5 relevant images along with similarity scores.

The video in this repo should calrify the requirements.

**Please commplete the Python notebook as a first step. You don't need to hand this in, but it walks you through implementation steps.**
